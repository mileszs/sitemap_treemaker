# Sitemap Treemaker
... 'cause all the clever names are taken, probably.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mileszs/sitemap_treemaker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mileszs/sitemap_treemaker)

**Problem**: I've got a basic sitemap.xml. It looks like this:

```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9
      http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/sitemap.xsd">

      <url><loc>http://someplace.org/</loc><changefreq>always</changefreq><priority>0.5</priority></url>
      <url><loc>http://someplace.org/about-someplace/</loc><changefreq>always</changefreq><priority>0.5</priority></url>
      <url><loc>http://someplace.org/about-someplace/board-of-directors/</loc><changefreq>always</changefreq><priority>0.5</priority></url>
    </urlset>
```

I need to build a tree out of all of these clearly hierarchal links. So, I do this:

```ruby

    sitemap_tree = SitemapTreemaker::Sitemap.new('http://someplace.org/sitemap.xml')
    sitemap_tree.tree
```

`tree` returns a `Tree::TreeNode` from the library [RubyTree](http://rubytree.rubyforge.org/). I can now take that tree and do something useful with it, maybe. Or, I could just print a pretty diagram:

```ruby
    sitemap_tree = SitemapTreemaker::Sitemap.new('http://someplace.org/sitemap.xml')
    sitemap_tree.print_tree_diagram

    #=>
    * root
    |---+ about-someplace
    |    |---> board-of-directors
```

## TODO

_???_

I'm sure there are other things that will need to happen in this gem. As I use it more, I'm sure it'll get fleshed out. If you've got ideas, send them to me by writing them with a thick black marker on the label on a Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA and mailing it to me or something. If you're also from Indiana, or one of the other states that Dogfish Head no longer serves... I don't know. Email me, or whatever.

Also, pull requests are welcomed. Prepare for poor response times, though.
